    <description><p>This is the overall data model for the project TibSchol - The Dawn of Tibetan Buddhist Scholasticism (11th-13th c.). This project has received funding from the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme (grant agreement No 101001002). It is hosted at the Institute for the Cultural and Intellectual History of Asia of the Austrian Academy of Sciences. Note: The description below is a work in progress.
